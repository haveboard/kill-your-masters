<h1>An effort to rename racist language in computer terminology</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Renaming default 'master' branch created by git to something more semantically appropriate like 'production', 'release', or 'main</li>
        <li>look into other languages that have already begun this effort</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This was inspired by a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/@leahculver"></a>@leahculver</a></p>

    <p>I refuse to use “whitelist”/“blacklist” or “master”/“slave” terminology for computers. Join me. Words matter.</p>

    <p>git operation:kill your masters” starts today.<p>

    <p>production or release seem more semantically correct anyways.</p>

    <p>Words matter (The “kill” In this respect is in reference to a non violent action of changing a programming convention)</p>

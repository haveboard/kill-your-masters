# An effort to rename racist language in computer terminology

    
Renaming default 'master' branch created by git to something more semantically appropriate like 'production', 'release', or 'main'. Looking into other languages that have already begun this effort in development.
    
This was inspired by a tweet from @leahculver [https://twitter.com/@leahculver]

To which I retweeted and said:

> git operation:kill your masters” starts today.

> production or release seem more semantically correct anyways.
